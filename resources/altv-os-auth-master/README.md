# Description

This repository provides an easy way to authenticate users into your database through the alt:V event emitters. Which basically means... put data in get data out in your other resources. This provides a simple decoupled method to authenticate your users and get an identifier through other events.

If you're looking for a Discord login system where you **do not** store emails, passwords, etc. Try out the [alt:V Discord Auth](https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-discord-auth) solution.

# Quick Install (alt:V Resource Installer)

More info here: [https://github.com/stuyk/altv-pkg](https://github.com/stuyk/altv-pkg)

```sh
# Install alt:V Installer
npm install -g altv-pkg
```

```sh
# Install with alt:V Installer
altv-pkg i stuyk/altv-os-auth
```

**Make sure to run the script after answering questions.**

# Setting Up Configuration

Create a file in your main directory called `config.json`.

Edit this file with any notepad program, ide, etc.

Add the following parameters to link up to your Mongo Database.

```json
{
    "db_url": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "db_database": "altv",
    "db_collections": ["accounts"],
    "db_username": null,
    "db_password": null
}
```

**db_url** is the URL of your MongoDB database. If on windows leave as localhost.

**db_database** is the name of the database where it will create a collection called `accounts`.

**db_username** is completely optional. Recommended in a production environment.

**db_password** is completely optional. Recommended in a production environment.

## Installing Dependencies / Installation

**I cannot stress this enough. Ensure you have NodeJS 13+ or you will have problems.**

-   [NodeJS 13+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
-   [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
-   An Existing or New Gamemode
-   General Scripting Knowledge

In your base gamemode directory where your `.exe` or `alt-server` files are. Simply run these commands.

```
npm install chalk
npm install simplymongo
npm install sjcl
```

After simply add the name of this resource to your `server.cfg` resource section.
Then simply clone this repository into your main server resources folder.

```
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-os-auth
```

Ensure your `package.json` includes this property:

```json
"type": "module"
```

# Events & Triggering Authentication

You have to hookup some general events to your gamemode to get things working.
Here's what you have to do.

## Show the Authentication Window

**Server-Side**

```js
alt.on('playerConnect', showAuthWindow);

function showAuthWindow(player) {
    alt.emitClient(player, 'auth:Open');
    console.log(`${player.name} has connected!`);
}
```

## Close the Authentication Window after Authenticating

This event specifically comes with some data from the player.
Such as their account database id, username, email, etc.

**Server-Side**

```js
alt.on('auth:Done', exitAuthWindow);

function exitAuthWindow(player, id, username, email) {
    alt.emitClient(player, 'auth:Exit');
    console.log(`${player.name} has authenticated!`);
    console.log(`Their Database ID is: ${id}`);
}
```
